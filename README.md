## Goal of the project

<br>
You have to deploy a simple e-commerce administration app in a Kubernetes cluster. <br><br>
Through this app, a visitor can manage a catalog and search products by keywords.
It has been built in a microservice architecture, composed of:

- a frontend application in Angular,
- an API in Laravel (PHP),
- an indexer in Node.JS,
- a reporting job in Go,
- 3 databases (MySQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch).
